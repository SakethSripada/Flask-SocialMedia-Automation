1. Create a python file called "secret.py" and add values for the following:
   API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER, MAIL_PASSWORD, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_SERVER, MAIL_USERNAME

   (the API_KEY is for OpenAI, rename if you wish)

2. ENSURE that you run the following commands for the Database to work:

  flask db init
  flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
  flask db upgrade

IF YOU DO NOT RUN THESE COMMANDS, THE TABLE WILL NOT BE CREATED IN THE DB, AND THE APP WILL NOT WORK!

3. Any time you make a change to the database, RUN:
   flask db migrate -m "Your change message"
   flask db upgrade

4. TO RUN APP, ENTER THE FOLLOWING INTO CLI: flask run

   Or set up run configuration with FlaskServer, do not use python app.py, this does not work


ENSURE THAT YOU COMPLETE ALL OF THE ABOVE STEPS! THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR THE APP TO WORK!

Commands:
Delete all users: flask delete-all-users
Delete one or more users: flask delete-users user1,user2,user3, etc        - TYPE USERS COMMA SEPARATED WITHOUT SPACES
List all users: flask list-users
